  abstract = {Rural credit in the Bohemian crown lands of the Habsburg monarchy became available on a wide scale only after the abolition of serfdom in 1848. Although organized to serve municipal interests, savings banks and Schulze-Delitzsch credit cooperatives initially provided rural credit, primarily in the form of mortgage loans. Such local financial institutions embraced a social mission of aiding the poor and promoting small producers, while seeking to encourage economic modernization and Czech national revival. Strengthening the economic position of small agricultural producers fit in with both the socioeconomic and national motives of local financial institutions in the 1860s and 1870s. With the agricultural depression of the 1880s, however, agrarian leaders criticized credit cooperatives and savings banks for promoting urban interests over those of their rural customers, and new financial institutions, particularly Raiffeisen-type cooperatives, were founded in the 1890s and 1900s to better meet the credit needs of small farmers. These new cooperatives contributed to the growing political and economic integration of the peasantry into the Czech national life.},

In this period when State\textendash Church relations emerged as a crucial political topic in Austria, the memory of Joseph II and his mother, who had first enforced state control over the Church as well as education, became a useful rhetorical instrument over policy legitimization. In the 1860s, the Austrian liberals claimed ideological continuity with Maria Theresa and Joseph II and used his name to attract historical depth in their aim of abolishing the Concordat of 1855, which had granted excessive legal and educational privileges to the Catholic Church. The advocates of the Concordat argued on the other hand that through this pact with the Vatican, the historic rights of the Church against state oppression -crystallized in the figure of Joseph II- were defended. Thorough analysis of how nineteenth-century Austrians perceived their past can be valuable both as a study on the aftermath of Enlightened Absolutism and, more importantly, in assisting to comprehend the worldview and motivation of the mid-century liberal politics in imperial Austria.},

These conflicting understandings of the purpose of trade fueled a battle between the Hungarian state and the Foreign Ministry over the information and transportation on which Austria-Hungary's trade development was based. The Hungarian state's success in this battle forced Austria-Hungary to pursue a much less imperialistic approach to global integration than the other great powers.},

  abstract = {Starting in the middle of the nineteenth century, the mainstream of Czech politics, in the spirit of maintaining a national ideology, tried to sustain a single-party system of political representation. By the end of the century efforts to do so proved ineffective. A politically maturing and differentiated society demanded appropriate political representation. The composition of the political party structure, as it was formulated during this time, was long term and established the tradition of a multiparty system in Czech politics. The differentiation into separate parties took place in the context of a confrontation between traditional national parties and the newly emerging parties that reflected the demands of different segments of society (the Social Democrats, Agrarian Parties and Christian Parties). This rebirth of the party system caused a considerable degree of tension within Czech politics, but the real political battles did not begin until the voting right laws were changed and a universal right to vote established. Parties were learning on the one hand to establish clear political identities and on the other hand to form both political coalitions and loosely knit working alliances. With respect to the actual developments of the Czech political environment, the study focuses on the development of relationships among Czech political parties, as they took place within the context of the Austria-Hungarian Imperial Council. These relationships are analysed on the basis of supporting parliamentary documents (proposals or interpellations), which were submitted during two comparable periods, the parliamentary meetings after the elections of 1907 and 1911.},

The defeat of the Austrian Empire came as a surprise to many contemporaries because the Austrian army was previously regarded as much more powerful. Searching for the causes, one reason was mentioned as a decisive factor in the public discussion: the poorer education of the Austrian soldiers when compared to those of the Prussians. Finally Prussia had a well-functioning school obligation, while the school system in Austria had numerous deficiencies. The slogan of the ``Prussian schoolmaster,'' who had defeated his Austrian counterpart, led the Austrian military to demand the introduction of compulsory schooling from the political leadership. Improved schooling should thus increase the efficiency of the army. In 1869, the Austrian parliament finally passed the Reichsvolksschulgesetz, which introduced eight-year compulsory schooling. The article examines the military influence on development, drafting and enforcement of the law and thus analyzes its impact on the evolution of the Austrian educational policy.},

At the beginning, the paper analyses the reform of citizenship laws in both Austria and Hungary after the Settlement of 1867. Whilst the Austrian citizenship law maintained legal traditions stretching back into the first half of the nineteenth century, the new Hungarian citizenship law of 1878 emulated the laws in effect in Wilhelmine Germany. The basis of Hungarian citizenship law was, however, much broader than German law, in order to allow for the effective integration of the non-Magyar population. An evaluation of applications for Austrian naturalisation illustrates the remarkable capacity of Austrian citizenship law to integrate and to uphold a concept of nationality independent from ethnicity, religious denomination, class or gender. Only during, and above all after, the First World War did the inclusive practice of the Cisleithanian bureaucracy give way to the more exclusive policy of the new German-Austrian Republic, as civil servants now introduced the vague notion of `race' as a criterion for naturalisation. In contrast to Tsarist Russia and the Second German Empire, both of which introduced similar agendas for nationalisation in the latter part of the nineteenth century linking citizenship to ethnic and religious identity, the Habsburg Monarchy remained basically untouched by such tendencies and with the constitutionally guaranteed principle of `national equality' upheld its early modern tradition of ethnic and religious tolerance well into the later Imperial period.},

His Prime Minister Hohenwart, the Czechs and their allies among the Conservative wing of Bohemian aristocrats worked out a programme known as the `Fundamental Articles'. The Emperor, it is argued, primarily wanted to persuade the Bohemians to end their boycott of the Vienna Parliament, thus freeing the crown from its dependence on the German Liberals. The Bohemians wanted the Emperor to impose a new constitution by tearing up the old one; the Emperor wanted the Bohemians to find a majority for their blueprint within the existing parliament even if the result was only going to be a very diluted version of the Fundamental Articles. The Bohemians, however, were unwilling to throw their principles overboard in return for such a flimsy chance of success. As a result, Francis Joseph turned his back on the Fundamental Articles. The failure of the 1871 programme was therefore not the result of a betrayal by the Emperor, but of a fundamental misunderstanding of his aims.},

At the same time, various concepts of groupness were active and in a process of constant negotiation. The article investigates how these discourses were constructed in Cisleithanian primary schoolbooks (Leseb\"ucher) in German, Italian and Croatian, and what narratives were used to express loyalty to the empire while simultaneously engaging with other (national, regional) collective identities. Education was a crucial field among a broad range of cultural practices in which awareness of the state as a whole was fostered \textemdash{} for example, by presenting Franz Joseph as the epitome of the good ruler, by focusing on the dynastic line or by presenting the empire as the organic sum of its various parts.

Als kulturelle Praktiken zeigen die Beispiele aus dem zentralen imperialen Gesellschaftsbereich Schule, wie z.B. die Inszenierung Kaiser Franz Josephs als Symbol guter Herrschaft, das Etablieren dynastischer Tradition und die Darstellung des Reiches als `Summe seiner Teile' wesentlich zur Konstruktion eines Gesamtstaatsbewusstseins beitrugen.},

  abstract = {Les propagandistes nationalistes, de m\^eme que de nombreux historiens, persistent \`a consid\'erer l'Autriche-Hongrie comme un empire, selon un sch\'ema traditionnel. Cela contribue \`a renforcer les th\'eories traditionnelles selon lesquelles l'Europe de l'Est serait d'une certaine fa\c{c}on en retard, semi-orientale et fondamentalement diff\'erente d'un "Occident" d\'emocratique d\'efini de mani\`ere nationale. Cependant, une analyse minutieuse des structures constitutionnelles et des formes de citoyennet\'e r\'ev\`ele qu'apr\`es le compromis de 1867, l'Autriche-Hongrie n'avait plus grand-chose en commun avec les autres empires continentaux. Elle constituait de fait \`a peine un \'Etat unifi\'e, et encore moins un empire. Apr\`es 1867, la Hongrie \'etait essentiellement un \'Etat-nation tandis que l'Autriche d\'eveloppait un syst\`eme politique pluraliste dans lequel aucune nationalit\'e n'\'etait dominante. Cet article analyse la formation conjointe du concept d'"empire" par les nationalistes et les loyalistes favorables aux Habsbourg, \`a la fois en Autriche-Hongrie et dans les \'Etats qui lui ont succ\'ed\'e, dans le but de contrer les puissants r\'ecits nationalistes sur cette r\'egion. /// Nationalist propagandists and many historians continue to view Austria-Hungary as an empire in traditional terms. This reinforces traditional theories that view Eastern Europe as somehow backward, semi-oriental, and fundamentally different from a democratic and nationally constituted 'West'. A close analysis of constitutional structures and forms of citizenship suggests that following the Compromise of1867 Austria-Hungary had little in common with other continental empires. In fact, it hardly constituted a single state at all, much less an empire. After 1867 Hungary became essentially a nation state, while Austria developed a pluralist political system within which there was no dominant nationality. This article examines the mutual constitution of the concept 'empire' by nationalists and by Habsburg loyalists, both in Austria-Hungary and retrospectively in the successor states, in order to diminish the power of nationalist narratives about the region.},

Between 1873 and 1910, with some exceptions, it was the Rothschild\textendash Creditanstalt\textendash Disconto-Gesellschaft consortium that acted in the role of the state banker in both halves of the dualistic state. The decision in favor of the Rothschilds was based not only on their extensive international network, rapid communications, immense prestige, an enormous amount of capital and a high degree of competitiveness but on the fact that they had long been heavily involved in Austrian financial affairs and in their quasi-monopoly position were able to assess relatively favorable costs. While the international market treated Hungary's state bonds as the public debt of a sovereign state, it still considered Austria and Hungary to be economically interdependent parts of the same, albeit politically dual, monarchy even as the threat of the dualist state's dissolution emerged more and more frequently from the turn of the century onwards. After initial hardships, yields on Hungary's state debt with some lag were able to keep up with the profitability on the again gradually increasing Austrian state debt.},

At this time Galicia was considered as one of the most backward regions of Europe, and this state of affairs was also noticed by Polish journalists, scientists, politicians and writers connected with Austrian partition of former Poland. However, it does not mean that the diagnoses as well as recipes for economic growth were concurrent. To the contrary, significant differences can be found between views on the development of Galicia. Moreover, these opinions changed over time. This article is an attempt to trace the evolution of these ideas, which was parallel to the changes in the situation of the province. The author does not present a complete picture of the problem of backwardness in multicultural Galicia, but he focuses on Polish writings, as a product of the politically dominant culture of the province.},

It reviews the current historiography on the topic, focusing mainly on the English example. Here some of the recent key debates within the field of labor history have been held, arguing that working-class action in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was shaped by a gender composite working-class culture that was inherently both masculine and feminine. Taking these debates as a yardstick, the paper explores how the codes and institutions of skilled labor masculinity shaped working-class collective action in pre-1848 Bohemia. Bohemia was, the study argues, one of the most industrialized regions next to England and France during the first half of the nineteenth century and also produced a significant amount of collective labor protests. The paper analyzes these protests in terms of their gender structure and compares this structure with the gender composition of the respective labor force. It comes to the conclusion that while the qualified labor force of the Bohemian textile industry, which generated the overall majority of all unrests, was gender-mixed, its protests were predominantly carried out by a crowd consisting only of men. The explanation for this discrepancy is found in the Bohemian working-class culture, which was shaped by male-friendly societies and brotherhoods. These brotherhoods constituted the institutional arena for the emergence of working-class masculinity, which went on to dominate the entire working-class culture and hence shaped the majority of collective protests as well.},

Czech and German politicians in Moravia reached an agreement in 1905. In the heavily mixed Bukovina, Romanian, Ukrainian, German, Jewish and Polish representatives agreed on a new provincial constitution in 1909. Last but not least, Polish and Ukrainian nationalists compromised in spring 1914, just a few months before the outbreak of the First World War vitiated the new provisions. Even though the provisions of these agreements varied substantially, new electoral laws introducing national registers were at their heart. These were designed to ensure a fairer representation of national groups in the provincial assemblies and to keep national agitation out of electoral campaigns. The earliest compromise in Moravia went furthest in consociational power sharing. However, the national bodies within the provincial assembly had no right to tax their respective national communities, and the provisions of the provincial constitutions kept the non-nationally defined nobility as an important counterbalance. The compromises in Bukovina and Galicia, even if they categorised all inhabitants nationally, contented themselves with even less autonomous agency for the national bodies in the provincial assemblies and rather emphasised the symbolic elements of national autonomy. The non-territorial approach in all three crownlands, however, was an instrument to reorganise multi-ethnic provinces that increasingly became the model for national compromises in other Austrian provinces.},

The second and third part of the essay deal with the consequences of the war for ethnic relations and the legitimacy of imperial rule. The atrocities against civilians committed by Austro-Hungarian and Russian soldiers accustomed the population to violence and lowered the threshold for the use of force to further own interests. The last part discusses how the end of the imperial framework and the changes to the international context contributed to a downward spiral of violence and the delineation of ethnic boundaries. The demise of Austria-Hungary brought a collapse of public order and chaotic violence. It led to the Polish\textendash Ukrainian war and antisemitic excesses. The victorious Polish authorities were no impartial arbiters and put the interests of the Polish nation and state above all else. The Entente, and later the League of Nations, were incapable of providing a political framework for a negotiated solution of the Polish\textendash Ukrainian conflict as, unlike Austria, they lacked both the ability and the will to enforce it.},

The context in which maps are created (production and consumption) is taken into consideration, as is the context which is created by maps (spaces as cultural products). The desired outcome is a synopsis of the plurality of spaces envisioned in the mid-nineteenth century contrasted with the process of unification of space spurred on by the continuous expansion of railway networks. Topics addressed in this article are the rendering of nature and terrain on maps, the beginning development of a railway corridor into a network of lines, the depiction of networks, the hierarchization of territory in the visual language of maps, and the marking of space as a national territory.},

On the one hand, there is an extensive historiography stressing the rise of nationalism and its close correlate of growing efforts to organize economic life along ethno-linguistic lines. On the other, there is a substantial body of research that emphasizes significant improvements in market integration across the empire as an outcome of the diffusion of industrialization and an expanding railway network, among other factors. In this article, it is argued that the process of market integration was systematically asymmetric, shaped by intensifying intra-empire nationality conflicts. While grain markets in Austria-Hungary became overall more integrated over time, they also became systematically biased: regions with a similar ethno-linguistic composition of their population came to display significantly smaller price gaps between each other than regions with different compositions. The emergence and persistence of this differential integration cannot be explained by changes in infrastructure and transport costs, simple geographical features, asymmetric integration with neighbouring regions abroad, or communication problems. Instead, differential market integration along ethno-linguistic lines was driven by the formation of ethno-linguistic networks due to intensifying conflict between groups\textemdash economic nationalism mattered.},

Its primary goal is to refute some already deep-rooted claims relating to Metternich's attitudes towards Russia and the Ottoman Empire from 1829 to 1833 and to offer a different assessment of his role in the diplomatic concert to the one generally held by proving firstly that Metternich did not fear Russia's policy towards the Ottoman Empire during this period, secondly that his policy was consistent and the meeting in M\"unchengr\"atz in 1833 was not such an important turning point in the Austrian\textemdash Russian relations but simply the climax of the already existing good relationship between the two conservative Powers, and, finally, that no Austro-Russian quid pro quo was agreed upon in this North Bohemian town, which means that Metternich did not have to give up Austrian interests in the Near East for the Russian support in the West because both countries' interests in the two areas were identical. Finally, the paper attempts to point out the fact that though Metternich's policy definitely was conservative, it cannot be sufficiently explained by such a superficial single-word labelling because much of his rationality based upon an in-depth analysis of the affairs lay beyond it, at least of those issues concerning the Eastern Question in the early 1830s.},

Although formally he was the sultan's subject administering some Ottoman provinces, in reality Mohammed Ali governed his dominions as an independent ruler, hence dividing the Ottoman Empire into two parts, one of them ruled from Constantinople and the other from Alexandria. The sultan's attempt to terminate the existence of this dual system ended in disaster; and in the midsummer of 1839, the empire found itself without its army, navy, and monarch, who died at the end of June.},

  abstract = {Historians generally depict the Italian peninsula after the Congress of Vienna as primarily under the influence of the Habsburg Empire. It is surprising, therefore, that some 150 years after the death of one of the most influential figures of the period, the Austrian Chancellor Clemens Wenzel Lothar Nepomuk Prince von Metternich (d. 1859), there is still no comprehensive study of his Italian policies, even though such a study would throw important new light on the final stage of Metternich's career at the Viennese Chancellery from 1830 to 1848. This paper addresses only a few months in this period, but it draws on the archives in Vienna, London, Moscow, Berlin, Munich, Brussels, Prague and D\v{e}\v{c}\'in to show that, although Metternich's Austria played a critically important role in the Italian politics, its influence in the southern part of the peninsula was considerably lower than is generally assumed. In fact, as will be shown, in this region the conservative central European monarchy had to share its influence with Great Britain and France. Nor did the two liberal powers automatically regard this area as an exclusive sphere of Habsburg influence, as became evident a quarter a century after the Congress during the so-called Sulphur Crisis in 1840, when a dispute between Great Britain and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies about the control over the production of the Sicilian sulphur led to a serious crisis that was finally solved by the mediation of France. As we shall see, Austria was excluded from the management of this crisis both because the British foreign Secretary, Henry John Temple Lord Palmerston, did not want to allow Metternich to play the role of arbitrator and because the Austrian influence over the court of Naples was in reality very weak.},

It analyzes these processes in a spatial perspective and with a focus on implementation. First, it shows that new spaces of administration were constructed on several levels, especially the districts themselves and the district offices. This was done not by unilaterally expunging earlier forms of spatial organization, but rather in complex interplay with them. Numerous groups of actors were involved in negotiating this, including not only politicians and bureaucrats, but also members of the general population in various roles. In this sense there was a substantial component of \guilsinglright state-building from below\guilsinglleft{} in the creation of the district administrations. Finally, some consequences arising from the new organization of space are outlined, from the quantitative increase in state administrative activity via improved possibilities for production and use of spatial knowledge to advances in the construction of the territory as a unitary space of the state.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Between 1907 and 1911, Imperial Austria experienced two major controversies concerning entanglements of science and religion. In 1907, the Innsbruck specialist in church law, Ludwig Wahrmund, publicly criticized the new `antimodernist' and antiscientific trends of Catholic science, causing semester-long protests, fights, university closures and heated parliamentary debates. Antagonized in Innsbruck, Wahrmund relocated to Prague. The controversy triggered by his work, however, united students from across the monarchy in Wahrmund's defence. In 1910, an analogous conflict arose in Cracow after Kazimierz Zimmermann was appointed professor of Catholic sociology. This time the protest against his teachings, although intensive, transgressed Galician boundaries only to a limited extent, failing to mobilize progressive student groups to go on the streets outside of the province. This article analyses the difference between protests against Wahrmund and Zimmermann from a spatial perspective. The author argues that the way both conflicts were received in politics and in local university cities indicates that there was an Imperial Austrian public sphere that transgressed national boundaries and linguistic divisions. Conflicts over contested topics, like the long-heated relationship between Church, science and higher education, were charged events that brought this public sphere to the fore. This translingual, imperial public sphere remained, however, hierarchically structured. A conflict in Innsbruck had more weight than one in Cracow, both within political discussions and in local presses.},

  abstract = {For a long time, the late period of the Habsburg Monarchy has been characterized as a battlefield of nation-building elites who employed historical scholarship (among other means) to promote nationalistic ideas. More recent studies, however, have examined and called attention to the powerful structures which held this monarchy together. In the age of historicism, the Habsburg Monarchy also needed a plausible historical narrative on which it could base claims of the legitimacy of its rule. This narrative was created first and foremost by Viennese historians. Yet there were historians in the Habsburg Monarchy's regional centres who made significant contributions to the development of concepts of an imperial history, too. In this article, the author examines their efforts. Until around 1900, supranationalism and regionalism were the dominant concepts in the historical writings of the authors in the Military Frontier and Bukovina and also in the works of the renowned Prague historian Anton Gindely. Loyal to Vienna, some Hungarian historians reassessed national history in order to reconcile it with the imperial past. Transnational history was also a method of demonstrating the congruity of national and imperial interests. In the age of high nationalism, historians thus contributed to both national and imperial cohesion.},

  abstract = {During the Napoleonic wars the future existence of Habsburg Galicia was regarded as uncertain, and in the period following the Congress of Vienna the identity of the province was likewise unclear. The eighteenth-century creation of Galicia gave way to the nineteenth-century attempt to create Galicians and to discover a non-national provincial meaning of "Galicia," capable of reconciling and transcending national, religious, and linguistic differences. In this article Larry Wolff juxtaposes the political perspective of Metternich and the literary perspective of dramatist Aleksander Fredro in order to analyze the imperial and provincial dynamics of the idea of Galicia, with further attention to the public sphere of newspapers and journals, and the cultural perspectives of Galicians like Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart (the son of the great composer) and J\'ozef Maksymilian Ossoli\'nski (founder of the Ossolineum library in Lviv). This article traces the evolving cultural meanings of Galicia up until 1835, the year of the death of Habsburg Emperor Franz and the year that Fredro was denounced by a Polish critic as a "non-national" writer. Especially in Fredro's celebrated comedies, it is possible to discern the submerged ideological tensions of empire and province that shaped Galician identity in the early nineteenth century.},
