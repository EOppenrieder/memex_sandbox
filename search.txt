Flockerzie\n\n1815, Metternich endeavoured to create a German states system —\ncontrolled as much as possible from Vienna —that would serve the\nstrategic and political interests of the Austrian Empire. If made immune\nfrom outside influence or incursions, the system would prevent France\nor the recently expanded Russian Empire from invading central Europe\nand utilizing its resources against the Austrian Empire, as had been the\ncase with the French-sponsored Rheinbund. Moreover, by keeping the\ntwo flanking powers of France and Russia out of central Europe and\nthus physically apart, a German defensive union would contribute to the\nstability and repose of the overall European states system. This last con-\nsideration was especially important to Metternich, as the Austrian Em-\npire emerged from the Napoleonic Wars territorially satiated and vitally\ninterested in the maintenance of the status quo.*\n\nAlthough Metternich would prove extremely flexible in carrying out\nhis German policy, he did not share the sentiment widespread at the time\nwhich called for a revival of the Holy Roman Empire under Habsburg\nleadership. Not only had the Empire proved unable to defend itself\nagainst outside aggression, but the continued existence of many of the\nGerman Rheinbund states, which precluded an Imperial restoration, had\nbeen guaranteed by Austria under the accession treaties of 1813. Hence-\nforth, these states, led by the middle-sized powers of Bavaria, Wirttem-\nberg, and Baden, would work assiduously to defend their independence\nand sovereignty. Perhaps the greatest obstacle to the revival of the Holy\nRoman Empire was the challenge from the second great power of Ger-\nmany, the kingdom of Prussia. Since the peace of Hubertusberg in 1763,\nPrussia had steadily expanded her power and influence in northern\nGermany, often at the expense of Habsburg Imperial pretensions. Cen-\ncentury was characterized by alternating rivalry and co-operation be-\ntween Berlin and Vienna.* Although nearly destroyed by Napoleon in\n1806, Prussia emerged from the War of Liberation determined to take\nfull advantage of the post-war reconstruction to regain and enhance her\nstatus as a European great power.

Even during the height of his collaboration with Prussia in\n1814, Metternich had tried to avoid totally alienating these states,\nholding them in reserve in the event of an unforeseen rift. Now that this\nhad occurred, he skilfully exploited their fear of Austro-Prussian co-\nhegemony, both as a lever against Prussia, who continued to argue for\ndualism, and to drum up support for Austrian leadership of a union of\nindependent states.

Vital questions such as the\ncompetence and authority of the federal diet, political and economic\nrelations between member states, and the organization of the confedera-\ntion’s military and foreign affairs were left unanswered. The catch-all\ntenth article of the Federal Act betrays the haste of the final weeks of\nthe congress of Vienna: ‘The first object to be considered by the diet\nafter its opening shall be the framing of the fundamental laws of the\nconfederation, and of its organic institutions with respect to its foreign,\nmilitary, and internal relations.’\"* Although the framers of the Federal\nAct had stipulated that the federal diet was to convene on 1 September\n1815, the diet did not in fact begin its work until 5 November 1816.\nThe intervening fourteen months constituted a highly unstable period in\nthe history of the German Confederation. Austria’s designated role as\nleader of the German states system was not taken for granted; indeed,\nall the agreements on German affairs reached at Vienna were placed in\ndoubt. Exacerbating this uncertainty in German affairs was the fact that\nthe entire settlement of 1815 was unstable and incomplete in the months\nfollowing the congress of Vienna and the second peace of Paris. Despite\nthe vast network of mutual obligations and multilateral agreements that\nhad been erected at Vienna and Paris, much in fact remained, as with\nthe Federal Act, unfinished or deferred. Numerous financial and terri-\ntorial clauses of the 1815 treaties remained to be executed. France, an\nessential component of the European balance of power, was temporarily\nremoved from participation in European affairs by the second peace of\nParis, which had placed the French kingdom under an Allied military\noccupation. French society, moreover, which had proven so volatile in\npast decades, appeared in late 1815 to be unreconciled to either the\nBourbon restoration or the national humiliation at Waterloo. The soli-\ndarity of the Allies, crucial for the maintenance of peace, emerged from\nthe difficult negotiations of 1814 and 1815 sorely tested. Widespread\ndissatisfaction with many aspects of the 1815 accords as well as the\nre-emergence of great power rivalry over the Eastern Question threat-\nened to undermine the international co-operation necessary for com-\npleting the unfinished work of the peace conferences.

The\ntrauma of the partition as well as the continued threat of Prussian ag-\ngression had placed the kingdom ‘in a difficult and delicate position’.”*\nAny change in the international situation, whether precipitated by a\nnew war, a prolonged diplomatic crisis, or a general revision of the\n1815 treaties, might well give Prussia the opportunity to annex the\nremainder of the kingdom. Thus, far from desiring to fish in troubled\nwaters, the Saxon foreign office after 1815 sought only to hold on to\nwhat had been left to it by the great powers at Vienna. The ultra-\nconservative Einsiedel and Friedrich August I were staunch advocates\nof the Holy Alliance, an organization which, for all its vagueness, held\nout to the Saxons the promise of peace and international co-operation.\nAccording to one of the first sets of diplomatic instructions to emerge\nfrom the Saxon foreign office after the partition, the king would con-\ncentrate upon reconstruction and internal affairs and ‘participate in\nforeign affairs only to the extent that it is necessary to ensure the security\nand defence of his kingdom and to fulfil his obligations as a member of\nthe German Confederation’.

At the start of\nthe congress, the Saxons assumed that Metternich’s private assurances\nof support and Austria’s strategic interest in maintaining Saxony as a\nbuffer state between Austria and Prussia would suffice to assure them of\nAustrian protection. Metternich’s decision in October 1814 to allow\nPrussian troops to occupy Saxony ‘provisionally’ came, therefore, as an\nunpleasant shock ;** similarly, during the partition, Einsiedel was severely\ncritical of (and hardly grateful for) Metternich’s agreement to Saxony’s\nenormous losses.** Both the necessity for—and the ambiguity of - Austrian\nsupport were expressed in October 1814 by the Saxon representative to\nthe congress, Friedrich Albrecht von der Schulenburg (1772-1853).

They noted with growing satisfaction\nthe cooling of relations between Russia and Prussia after the second\npeace of Paris as well as the apparent revival of Russia’s traditional\ninterest in protecting the smaller powers of Germany.

Equally inimical were Austro-Prussian sugges-\ntions of the partial restoration of the mediatized nobility. As the congress\nprogressed, Wiirttemberg and Bavaria began to consult with Baden and\nother states that felt similarly threatened, such as Hesse-Darmstadt and\nNassau. From these consultations emerged the idea of a league of secon-\ndary German states designed to thwart the hegemonic designs of Prussia\nand Austria; an early manifestation of the so-called Third Germany or\nTrias idea, which would punctuate the entire history of the German\nConfederation. Between 1815 and 1866, the Trias idea would manifest\nitself in various forms, but always assume that the best organization of\nGermany would be trialist: the two great powers, Austria and Prussia,\nshould share the leadership with a third, but equal, bloc of small and\nmiddle-sized states.”* Trias sentiment became widespread in late 1814,\nafter the introduction of the Austro-Prussian Twelve Articles which\nwould have come close to establishing Austro-Prussian hegemony over\nthe other German states.\n\nThe interest in a Trias league abated temporarily in early 1815, as\nthe immediate threat of Austro-Prussian hegemony subsided as a result\nof the Saxon crisis. Nevertheless, suspicions lingered regarding the sin-\ncerity of Metternich’s conversion to federalism and a number of secon-\ndary states adhered to the Federal Act reluctantly and with reservations.\nBavaria signed only at the last possible moment, while Wiirttemberg\nand Baden waited until after the close of the congress.”* The refusal of\nthe great powers to allow the secondary states to participate in the nego-\ntiations for the second peace of Paris as well as the failure of the federal\ndiet to open on schedule served to keep alive the Trias idea throughout\nlate 1815.

The\nfirst article provided for a mutual guarantee of the territorial possessions\nof the signatories; other articles for the member states to consult and\nvote en bloc in the federal diet on matters concerning state sovereignty\nand jointly to oppose all that was ‘contrary to the clear sense of the\nFederal Act’.”* Wiirttemberg apparently hoped to expand the league\nbeyond south Germany by inviting Hesse-Darmstadt and Saxony to\naccede.\n\nAs a middle-sized state clearly threatened by great power politics,\nSaxony was a prime candidate for membership in such a league. In later\nyears, after the consolidation of the confederation, Saxony would join\nand, under Count Beust, play a leading role.”* During the confedera-\ntion’s formative years, however, Saxony remained decidedly aloof. The\nTrias project of 1816 was viewed in Dresden as neither an opportunity\nnor a refuge, but as an unwanted threat to the confederation and to\nSaxony.” To be sure, Einsiedel appreciated the community of interest\nshared by the secondary states in an international system dominated by\nthe great powers; Saxony’s experiences at the congress of Vienna had\ngiven him first-hand knowledge of the threat posed by the great power\nAreopagus. From the same experiences, however, he and Friedrich\nAugust I concluded that the survival of both Saxony and the settlement\nof 1815 would depend on the great powers, especially, in the German\ncontext, Austria, In dealings with the secondary states after 1815, Ein-\nsiedel always advocated close co-operation and mutual support, but\nwithin the bounds of the 1815 treaties and never in a manner that might\nirritate the great powers. That the support and friendship of the secon-\ndary states was of limited utility for Saxony had been brought home\nduring the congress, when their protests at Saxony’s treatment had been\nignored or stified.”\n\nAside from these sobering lessons from 1814-15, reports on Trias\nactivity reaching Dresden in early 1816 served further to dampen any\nenthusiasm to join the movement.

While patriots proclaimed republics\nacross the continent, royal houses had mostly regained control by 1849.\nThe year 1848 nevertheless marks a turning point in European history, and\nwitnessed, among other things, the apogee of Slavism as a political force.\nSlavic feeling during the 1848 Revolution manifested itself most visibly\nand dramatically in the Prague Pan-Slav Congress, which convened on 21\nMay 1848.

As J. P. T. Bury wrote, “the whole episode was\nhighly characteristic of 1848 ... for all the expressions of good-will and\nunity it failed to agree upon any serious problems at issue.” Yet if the\nPrague Pan-Slav Congress, like the 1848 Revolutions generally, failed to\nestablish new political structures, it remained, like the 1848 Revolutions\ngenerally, a dramatic turning point in the lives of those who experienced it.\n\nDuring the 1848 Revolution, Sorbian patriots, like their Slavic\ncounterparts in the Habsburg Empire, tried to adapt their predominantly\nliterary understanding of nationality to a divisive political confrontation.\nDifferent intellectuals reacted in quite different ways. Jan Kollar, for\nexample, proved wholly disinterested in political action and withdrew from\npublic life for the duration.

In Peter Brock’s words, Jordan “became\nincreasingly integrated into the life of the Austro-Slavs ... the Lusatian\nSerb chapter in his life had closed in 1848.” Intriguingly, Jordan had\nforeseen his possible de-Sorbianization while still in his Leipzig exile.\nDispirited by his failure to awaken Slavic patriotism among his students in\nLeipzig, Jordan had written in a letter to Hanka: “I would like indeed to\nhave been born a Czech — or a Serb under Turkey. Who knows what will\nbecome of me? Perhaps in a couple of years I will be a Serb or an\nIHyrian™*\n\nSmoler, by contrast, restricted his attention to Saxon affairs.

This gave Metternich his chance to revive the mediation project,\nand on 4 June France, Russia and Prussia signed the armistice of Pleiswitz, pro-\nviding for a truce until 20 July, before which Austria would convene a congress\nat Prague to broker peace between France and her enemies.\n\nMetternich’s ‘armed mediation’ was deeply controversial at the time, and has\nremained so since. Almost all the French historiography holds that it was sim-\nply a ruse which enabled Austria to change sides in stages while avoiding the\nimpression of betraying Napoleon too flagrantly. For this school, the compro-\nmise peace proposals Metternich did put forward after 1812, far from being sin-\ncere, veered at different times from being impossibly vague, to far too harsh for\nNapoleon to accept. in both cases, the aim was not to make a genuine settlement\nwith Napoleon, but to cast him as an incorrigible warmonger, widening the gulf\nbetween himself and moderate opinion within France, and paving the way for\nhis overthrow. This interpretation received its classic form in the last volume of\nAlbert Sorel’s l'Europe et la Révolution Francaise, which appeared in 1904.The\nmost important recent French study of the Napoleonic empire, Thierry Lentz’s\nNouvelle Histoire du Premier Empire, completed in 2010, echoes Sorel’s ver-\ndict on Metternich’s policy:‘une diplomatie cynique mais 6 combien habile’.*\n\nAnglo-Saxon and German historians have been more inclined to give\nMetternich the benefit of the doubt. The most influential recent exponent of\nthis line has been Paul Schroeder. In his major work, The Transformation of\nEuropean Politics, 1763-1848, Schroeder argues forthrightly that Austria's\npeace plan was sincerely meant: ‘Austria ... wanted peace, an end to war, full\nstop? Furthermore, this plan emphatically did not include the overthrow of\nNapoleon. In analysing Metternich’s policy, Schroeder claims,\n\nthe one thing impossible to find is evidence of hostility to Napoleon\nor a desire to oppose him, much less overthrow him. Napoleon's\ndefeat in Russia, for example, caused Metternich real dismay. The\nevidence indicates that Metternich saw the best chance for achiev-\ning his kind of peace ... through close ties between Austria and a\nNapoleonic France which was still the dominant power in Western\nEurope.}3\n\nThe gulf between defenders of Napoleon and defenders of Metternich is not\nlikely to be bridged soon, especially since Metternich’s diplomacy, always subtle,\nwas so tortuous in these years that it can be interpreted in various, and often\nopposing, ways. Yet for both schools of thought, the meeting of 26 June 1813 is\ncrucial. For Napoleon's defenders, it shows Metternich at his treacherous worst,\n\n® For example: Sorel, LEurope et ta Révolution Francaise, viii. 84-91, 137-8; Lentz, Nouvelle\nHistoire, ii. 398.\n13 Schroeder, The Transformation of European Politi\n\n  \n\n460, 465.\n\nOSQ/ZSr/ P/AZ/MOMeUicO dno alweapBoR/sdyy wow DaDEGILMOK\n\nSi\n\nOZOZ ssqol9g Z| uo sesn Areigr] Aysieaiup) BuualA Ag g/:\n\f"

Instead, they claim, it was simply a means of prolonging the armi-\nstice until a rearmed Austria was ready to join the ranks of France’s enemies.\nFor Napoleon’s detractors, the Dresden meeting marks the moment at which\nhis bellicosity and unwillingness to consider an acceptable peace convinced\nMetternich that compromise was now impossible and that Austria had no option\nbut to take the field against France.'4\n\nThe two traditional accounts, Fain's and Metternich’s, agree on the broad out-\nline of the meeting. Napoleon, they claim, attempted to avoid Austria’s mediation,\nrelying instead on a mixture of cajolery and threats to keep her neutral. He lost\nhis temper when Metternich refused to be deflected, accusing him of betraying\nthe Franco-Austrian alliance. In a fury he threw his hat across the room, only to\npick it up in some embarrassment a little later. By the end of the interview, how-\never, the emperor had recovered his self-control. The two men parted on reason-\nably civil terms, and Metternich was able to return to Francis I with Napoleon's\nagreement to participate in a peace conference at Prague in July.!°\n\nYet there are key differences between Fain’s and Metternich’s recollections.\nFain states that Napoleon agreed to the peace congress at the end of the meet-\ning. Metternich, on the other hand, maintains that this was only conceded four\ndays later, just before he stepped into his carriage to leave Dresden. The dra-\nmatic phrase with which Metternich remembers ending the meeting: ‘Sire, vous\nétes perdu!’ is not in Fain’s account. On matters of substance, Fain asserts that\nNapoleon twice offered Austria the return of Illyria, which he had taken from\nher in 1809, as the price of her neutrality, while Metternich makes no refer-\nence to this. Fain also claims that Napoleon accused Metternich of having been\nbribed by England to change sides: ‘Ah! Metternich, combien l’ Angleterre vous-\na-t-elle donné pour vous décider a jouer ce réle contre moi?’ Unsurprisingly, this\nfigures nowhere in Metternich’s version.'©\n\nOn one critical issue, however, Fain and Metternich are inconclusive. Did\nMetternich put concrete proposals to Napoleon for a territorial settlement to\nend the war? This question is of central importance to the defenders and detrac-\ntors of both men and, by extension, of the causes they represented. If Metternich\ndid not, then the argument of the traditional French school, that his aim was\nnot peace but to trap Napoleon into negotiations that would divide him from\nFrench public opinion, is much strengthened. If he did, then Napoleon’s refusal\neven to discuss these terms in detail, at Dresden and subsequently, reinforces the\nopposing view of his obstinacy and belligerence. In his own account, Metternich\ndoes not mention that he brought territorial proposals to Napoleon, which\n\n \n\n4 Lentz, Nouvelle Histoire, ii. 414-16, Schroeder, The Transformation of European Politics,\n470-71.\n\n18 Fain writes merely ‘le chapeau de l'Empereur est tombé a terre’, Metternich ‘mit diesem Ausruf\nwarf er den Hut, welchen er bisher in der Hand gchalten, in die Ecke des Zimmers’.
